# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
For this assignment, we were tasked with helping Bobby answer question as an HR Analyst. We wanted to know who would be retiring in the next few years and how many positions Pewlett-Hackard would need to fill. We were able to generate a list of employees eligible for the retirement package and a list of how many job titles would be open after a generation of employees retired. We were then asked to go further, to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
