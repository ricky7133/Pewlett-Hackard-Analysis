# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
For this assignment, we were tasked with helping Bobby answer question as an HR Analyst. We wanted to know who would be retiring in the next few years and how many positions Pewlett-Hackard would need to fill. We were able to generate a list of employees eligible for the retirement package and a list of how many job titles would be open after a generation of employees retired. We were then asked to go further, to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* We created a table that allowed us to see which employees are eligible to retire. That table is in the retirment_titles.csv file. There are 90,398 employees eligible to retire.
* We were able to find out which departments those employees were eligible to retire from the retiring titles table. We now know that there is 29,414 Senior Engineers, 28,254 Senior Staff, 14,222 Engineers, 12,243 Staff, 4,502 Technique Leaders, 1,761 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers eligible to retire.

## Summary
There will be 13,505 employees that are leaving. This number represents the number of employees that have been there since 1985 to 1988 and were born between 1962 and 1965. As the "silver tsunami" begins, thatâ€™s how many employees would need to be filled so that the company can continue to operate efficiently.
